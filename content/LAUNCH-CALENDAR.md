# MEDICI Launch Content Calendar — Week 1 & 2

## Week 1: "The Announcement"

### Monday (Day 1) — LAUNCH
**X Post (AM):**
I just launched an AI-first marketing agency.

No office. No junior team. No bloated retainers.

Just AI-powered systems + senior strategy.

It's called MEDICI. Here's why 👇

**X Thread (PM):**
Why I'm building MEDICI — a thread:

1/ I've spent 7 years in Web3 marketing. Sui Foundation, Interest Labs, DeepSquare. I've seen how marketing works at every stage.

2/ The problem: traditional agencies are broken. Slow. Expensive. Run by account managers who've never built anything.

3/ Meanwhile, AI can now do 80% of marketing execution — faster and better. But nobody is orchestrating it properly.

4/ That's MEDICI. We combine founder-level strategy with AI-powered execution. 10x the output at a fraction of the cost.

5/ We don't sell packages. Every engagement is bespoke — scoped around what your company actually needs.

6/ Starting from €3,000/mo. 3-month minimum. You work directly with me.

7/ If you're a startup or tech company that needs marketing infrastructure that actually scales — let's talk.

**LinkedIn:**
Announcing MEDICI — an AI-first marketing agency for startups and tech companies.

After 7+ years in Web3 marketing (Sui Foundation, Interest Labs, DeepSquare), I've seen the same pattern: startups either overpay for slow agencies or struggle with scattered freelancers.

AI changes this equation completely.

MEDICI builds marketing infrastructure powered by AI — content engines, growth systems, and analytics that work 10x faster than traditional approaches. But every output is human-reviewed and strategically directed.

We don't sell packages. We scope each engagement around what your company needs.

Starting from €3,000/mo. Discovery calls are open.

### Tuesday (Day 2) — AI VALUE PROP
**X Post (AM):**
The average marketing agency charges $10K/mo and delivers a monthly PDF report.

We charge €3K/mo and deliver real-time dashboards, 10x content output, and systems that compound.

AI doesn't just make us faster. It makes the old model obsolete.

**X Thread:**
How AI actually changes marketing (not the hype version):

1/ Content: AI drafts → human review → 10x output. One strategist can now do what took a team of 5.

2/ Analytics: Real-time dashboards that surface insights automatically. No more waiting 30 days for a report.

3/ Outreach: AI-personalized emails at scale. 5x response rates vs generic templates.

4/ Ad copy: Generate 50 variants, A/B test, optimize — in the time it takes to write 2 manually.

5/ The key: AI handles execution. Humans handle strategy, taste, and relationships.

That's the MEDICI model.

### Wednesday (Day 3) — BEHIND THE BUILD
**X Post (AM):**
Day 3 of building MEDICI.

Website: live
Email: set up
Content engine: automated
First discovery calls: booked

Total cost so far: €12 (domain)

AI-first means lean from day one.

**LinkedIn:**
I built an entire agency website in one afternoon using AI.

Not a template. Not Wix. A custom-coded, single-file HTML site with:
- Particle network animations
- Scroll-triggered reveals
- Responsive design
- Full SEO setup

Deployed to Vercel. Total cost: €12 for the domain.

This is what AI-first means in practice. The tools exist. The question is whether you know how to orchestrate them.

### Thursday (Day 4) — GROWTH INSIGHT
**X Post (AM):**
Most startups don't have a marketing problem. They have a systems problem.

They post when they remember. They report when someone asks. They optimize when things break.

Marketing infrastructure > marketing activities.

**X Thread:**
The 5 marketing systems every startup needs (and how AI makes them 10x easier):

1/ Content engine — Not "post sometimes." A system that produces consistently.

2/ Distribution machine — Every piece of content should hit 3+ channels automatically.

3/ Analytics dashboard — Real-time. Not a spreadsheet someone updates monthly.

4/ Outreach pipeline — Personalized, tracked, automated follow-ups.

5/ Feedback loop — What's working feeds back into what you create next.

AI can power all 5. Most startups use it for zero.

Things I've helped build:

→ Sui Foundation's developer ecosystem (Ambassador)
→ Interest Labs marketing → 1st place Sui Overflow Hackathon
→ DeepSquare community from 0
→ Won the Lugano Plan ₿ Challenge with Tether

Now I'm building the marketing infrastructure for your startup.

Building in public because I believe in transparency. If you're curious about the AI-first agency model, follow along.
