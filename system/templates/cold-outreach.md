Hi {{name}},

{{personalized_opener}}

I run MEDICI — we build AI-powered marketing infrastructure for startups. Instead of slow agencies and bloated retainers, we deliver 10x the output at a fraction of the cost.

{{specific_value_prop}}

Would a 15-minute call make sense this week?

Best,
Mario

## Rules
- Max 5 sentences in body
- Personalized opener references something specific (their product, raise, tweet, job posting)
- Specific value prop ties to their actual gap
- No attachments, no links (except medici.codes in sig)
- Never sound like a template
