Hi {{name}},

Just floating this back up. I know inboxes are brutal.

Happy to jump on a quick call if timing works better now.

{{name}} — last note from me on this.

If the timing isn't right, no worries at all. If it ever is, I'm at mario@medici.codes.

## Rules
- Max 2 follow-ups per lead
- Each follow-up adds new value (insight, relevant news, etc.)
- Never guilt-trip or pressure
- Follow-up 2 is the breakup email — graceful exit
