# MEDICI — Agency Master Document

## Phase 1: Brand & Positioning

### 01 — Agency Overview

**What is Medici?**
Medici is an AI-first marketing agency built for startups and tech companies. We combine the strategic thinking of a senior marketing team with AI-powered execution — delivering faster, smarter, and more cost-effective growth systems than traditional agencies.

**The Core Idea**
The Medici family were history's greatest growth hackers. They didn't just fund art — they built infrastructure that compounded over generations. That's exactly what we do for our clients: we build the marketing infrastructure that scales.

### 02 — Brand Identity

**Name:** MEDICI
Named after the Medici family of Florence — history's most powerful patrons of growth, innovation, and empire-building. The name carries weight, legacy, and strategic intelligence without saying a single buzzword.

**Domain:** medici.codes
The .codes extension signals craft, technical precision, and an agency that builds systems — not just campaigns. It's distinctive in a sea of .com agencies and immediately communicates our AI-first nature.

**Tagline Options**

| | |
|---|---|
| Primary | Growth, engineered. |
| Alternative 1 | The growth layer for startups. |
| Alternative 2 | Built to scale you. |
| Alternative 3 | Behind every breakout brand. |
| Alternative 4 | Marketing infrastructure for builders. |

**Recommended:** "Growth, engineered." — Minimal, precise, and positions Medici as a technical growth partner rather than a creative agency.

**Positioning Statement**
Medici is an AI-first marketing agency for startups and tech companies. We build the growth systems, content engines, and brand infrastructure that help builders scale — faster and smarter than traditional agencies.

**Brand Voice**

| | |
|---|---|
| Tone | Precise, confident, strategic |
| Register | Professional but human — never corporate |
| Language | Technical enough to earn startup trust |
| What we are | A partner, not a vendor |
| What we avoid | Buzzwords, fluff, over-promising |

### 03 — Visual Identity Direction

**Color Palette**

| Role | Color | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| Primary | Obsidian Black | #0A0A0A |
| Secondary | Warm Gold | #C9A84C |
| Base | Off White | #F5F5F5 |
| Text | Mid Grey | #555555 |
| Accent (optional) | Electric Blue | #0066FF |

**Typography**

| Use | Style |
|---|---|
| Wordmark / Logo | Serif typeface — weight and authority (e.g. Playfair Display, Cormorant) |
| Headlines | Bold sans-serif — clean and commanding (e.g. Inter, Neue Haas Grotesk) |
| Body Copy | Regular sans-serif — readable and modern (e.g. Inter, DM Sans) |
| Accent / Quotes | Light italic serif — premium editorial feel |

**Logo Direction**
A geometric monogram M — constructed from precise angles, minimal strokes, no decorative elements. Think Linear, Stripe, Arc. The mark should work equally well at 16px favicon size and billboard scale.

| | |
|---|---|
| Style | Geometric monogram — M lettermark |
| Feel | Timeless, not trendy |
| Usage | Dark on light / Gold on dark / White on dark |
| Avoid | Gradients, drop shadows, illustrated icons |

**Design References**
- Stripe — precision and developer trust
- Linear — premium dark UI, technical confidence
- Basement Studio — bold, editorial, intentional whitespace
- Vercel — minimal, speed-coded, startup-native

**Design Principles**
- No gradients — flat, structured, intentional
- Generous whitespace — let ideas breathe
- One accent color max per composition
- Typography does the heavy lifting
- Every element earns its place

### 04 — Market Positioning

**Target Clients**

| Tier | Segment |
|---|---|
| Primary | Seed to Series B tech startups needing to build their marketing foundation |
| Secondary | Web3 / Crypto projects — DeFi protocols, L1/L2 chains, consumer apps |
| Tertiary | Growth-stage companies replacing or augmenting in-house marketing teams |

**The Problem We Solve**
- Traditional agencies are too slow, too expensive, and not built for startup pace
- In-house hiring is costly and takes 3–6 months to ramp up
- Freelancers lack strategic oversight and integrated execution
- AI tools exist everywhere but nobody is orchestrating them intelligently

**The Medici Difference**

| Dimension | Traditional Agency | Medici |
|---|---|---|
| Speed | Weeks per deliverable | Days — AI accelerates everything |
| Cost | High retainers ($10K+/mo) | Premium but efficient ($3K–8K/mo) |
| Strategy | Account managers | Founder-level strategic thinking |
| Output | Manual production | AI pipelines + human oversight |
| Reporting | Monthly PDFs | Real-time dashboards |
| Network | Generic | Deep Web3 + startup ecosystem |

**Competitive Moat**
- Web3 / startup network (Sui, DeepSquare, Interest Labs connections)
- AI-native workflows — 10x output at fraction of cost
- Founder-operator mentality — we think like clients, not vendors
- Brand positioning that commands premium pricing
